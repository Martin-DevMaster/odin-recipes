    <h2>Marinated Elk Steak with Whiskey</h2>
    <p>his is such a flavorful recipe and is great enjoyed on the grill with a little advanced planning. Elk steaks
        don't really need anything and are great by themselves, but if you are looking to add some extra flavor, this
        marinade is sure to please!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 Elk Steaks</li>
        <li>1/2 Cup Whiskey</li>
        <li>1/2 Cup Brown Sugar</li>
        <!-- List goes on and on, search google for more. And don't drink the WHISKEY! -->
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1: In a large bowl mix all the ingredients for the marinade together and pour into a large resealable
            bag. Add the Elk steaks and coat well. Seal the bag and refrigerate for 6-12 hours.</li>
        <li>Heat grill to medium heat and remove steaks from bag and discard marinade. We recommend no more than
            medium-rare, so 5-7 minutes per side maximum cooking time.</li>
        <li>Remove from grill and enjoy the beauty you've created.</li>
    </ol>
